# psmove-vr
A way to play SteamVR games without a real VR headset (kinda).

Do you have old PSMove controllers laying around and an old camera? Well well well, you can finally use them to play VR games! PSMoveVR achieves that by replicating the PSVR functionality so that it works with *every* headset and *every* PCVR game!

I will release the current source code in a few days, the beta is almost done!

WIP - The project is still in it's early develelopement stage, so here's a list of things that I already did and things that I plan to do:

+ ✔ Controller position and rotation tracking
+ ✔ Connection to SteamVR (Custom driver)
+ ✔ Compatibility for *every* real VR game

What am I doing right now:
- Adding multiple controller support and Linux

Future ideas:
- 3D engine in the program so it's more user-friendly
- WinUI3?
- Head tracking using a LED diode and a ping-pong ball
- Joystick on the controller using a hybrid of the JoyCon and the PSMove, or a custom 3D printed mount
