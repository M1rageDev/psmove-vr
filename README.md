A way to play SteamVR games without real VR controllers.

Do you have old PSMove controllers laying around and an old camera? You can finally use them to play VR games! PSMoveVR achieves that by replicating the PSVR functionality so that it works with *every* headset and *every* PCVR game!

What am I doing right now:
- Adding multiple controller and Linux support

Future ideas:
- Switching to C# or C++
- 3D engine in the program so it's more user-friendly
- WinUI3?
- Head tracking using a LED diode and a ping-pong ball
- Joystick on the controller using a hybrid of the JoyCon and the PSMove, or a custom 3D printed mount
